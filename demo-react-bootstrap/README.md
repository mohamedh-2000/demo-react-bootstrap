# React-Bootstrap Demo

This project shows a concise demo for your 4â€“6 minute video:
- Card + Button
- Modal controlled by React `useState`
- Dismissible Alert

## Why we don't add a separate "plain Bootstrap" project
The presentation already includes side-by-side code comparisons (HTML classes vs. React components).
For the short video, it's better to focus on a single running demo that highlights React state control.
If you really want to add a comparison, add one extra slide or a short code snippet in the video.
